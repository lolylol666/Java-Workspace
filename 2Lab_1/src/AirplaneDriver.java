		// c) Create a 1st entry in the array using the default constructor
		// which you store in the array created in step b)
		



		
		// d) Prompt the user for the information to create 2 other objects of type Airplane and store them in the
		// same array
		


		
		// e) Increase the crew size of the 2nd Airplane by 2   
		
		


		// f) Create a 4th object which has the crew size of the 3rd Airplane in Fleet and the 
		// 1st Airplane's destination
		
		


		// g) Create a new Airplane with exactly the same information as the Airplane in index location 2
		



		
		// h) Display a message saying how many airplanes there are as well as
		// the information of all airplanes. Make use of the static attribute numOfPlanes
		// for the number of Airplanes.
		
		


		
		// i) Compare the Airplane in location 2 to the remaining Airplane objects in the array and 	
		// display a message of the format
		// airplane 2 (is/is not) the same as airplane i
		// for the remaining airplanes, using the equals method
